             <h1>ABOUT X-RAY</h1>
X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation that use a small dose of ionizing radiation to produce images of the body's internal structures. They are commonly used to diagnose and treat a variety of medical conditions, including bone fractures, tumors, and infections. 
<h1>Here's a more detailed explanation:</h1>
<img src="what-is-an-x-ray-1192147-8d86ed793e6649e6943b35c8accf0cea.png" alt="sun" style="width:1000px;height:400px;">
<h2>What are X-rays?</h2>
X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation with a shorter wavelength than visible light. They are produced when electrons are accelerated to high speeds and then collide with a target material, typically made of tungsten. 
<h2>How are X-rays used?</h2>
X-rays are used to create images of the body's internal structures by passing through the body. The images are created by recording the amount of X-rays that are absorbed or scattered by different tissues. 
<h2>What are X-rays used for?</h2>
X-rays can be used to diagnose and treat a variety of medical conditions, including:
<p>Bone fractures.</p> 
<p>Tumors. </p>
<p>Infections. </p>
<p>Foreign bodies. </p>
<p>Some types of injuries. </p>
<h2>Are X-rays safe?</h2>
X-rays are generally considered safe, but there is a small risk of radiation exposure. The amount of radiation exposure from an X-ray is typically very small and is less than the amount of radiation that people are exposed to from natural background radiation over several days. 
<h2>Are there any risks involved?</h2>
<h3>There are some risks associated with X-rays, including:</h3>
<p>Radiation exposure. </p>
<p>Potential for allergic reactions to contrast dyes.</p> 
Are there any alternatives?
Yes, there are other imaging techniques that can be used instead of X-rays, including:
<p>CT scans.</p> 
<p>MRI scans.</p> 
<p>Ultrasound. </p>
