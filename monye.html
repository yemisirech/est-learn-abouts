             <h1>ABOUT MONEY</h1>
When a bank account owner dies, the bank will usually freeze the account to protect the assets until the legal procedures are completed. If a beneficiary or executor has been named, they will typically have access to the funds after providing the bank with proof of death and their own identity. If no beneficiary or executor is named, the account will be handled through the probate process. 
<h1>Here's a more detailed breakdown:</h1>
<h1>Beneficiaries:</h1>
Banks may allow account holders to designate a beneficiary, who can receive the funds upon the account holder's death. 
<h1>Executors:</h1>
If the deceased had a will, the executor named in the will can access the funds, but usually after receiving permission from a probate court. 
<h1>Trustees:</h1>
If a trust was established, the trustee named in the trust will manage and distribute the assets according to the deceased's wishes. 
<h1>Probate:</h1>
If there's no beneficiary or executor, the account will be handled through probate, a legal process to distribute assets to heirs. 
<h1>Joint Accounts:</h1>
If the deceased was a joint owner of an account, the surviving joint owner(s) will usually have access to the funds. 
<h1>Intestacy:</h1>
If the deceased died without a will, the state's intestacy laws will determine who inherits the assets. 
<h1>Documentation:</h1>
Proof of death, such as a death certificate, is usually required to access or close the account.
