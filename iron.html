             <h1>ABOUT IRON</h1>Iron is a crucial mineral for various bodily functions, including oxygen transport in the blood. Dietary sources of iron include both heme and non-heme forms, with heme iron from animal sources being more easily absorbed than non-heme iron from plant sources. Iron deficiency can lead to anemia and other health problems, so it's important to meet daily iron needs through diet or supplements, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 
<h1>Iron Sources:</h1>
<h1>Heme Iron:</h1>
 Found in animal products like red meat, poultry, and seafood.
<h1>Non-Heme Iron:</h1>
 Found in plant-based foods like beans, lentils, spinach, and tofu, as well as iron-fortified foods. 
<h1>Iron Absorption:</h1>
Heme iron is more easily absorbed than non-heme iron.
Vitamin C can enhance iron absorption from plant sources.
Certain compounds in food and drinks, like tannins in tea and coffee, can hinder iron absorption. 
<h1>Recommended Dietary Intake (RDI):</h1>
The RDI for adults (19-50 years) is 8 mg for men and 18 mg for women.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding have higher iron needs.
The RDI for children and teenagers varies by age and gender. 
<h1>Iron Deficiency:</h1>
Iron deficiency can lead to fatigue, poor concentration, and anemia.
Causes of iron deficiency can include poor iron intake, blood loss, or problems with iron absorption.
Treatment may involve dietary changes, iron supplements, or addressing underlying causes. 
<h1>Important Considerations:</h1>
Excessive iron intake can be harmful and lead to iron overload.
Consult a healthcare professional for guidance on iron intake, especially if you have concerns about iron deficiency or iron overload.
