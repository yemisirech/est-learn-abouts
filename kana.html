             <h1>ABOUT KANGARO</h1>
Kangaroo deaths can occur due to various factors, including natural causes, human activities, and environmental changes. Common causes include vehicle collisions, disease, starvation, and predation. Human-related threats like hunting and vehicle collisions are particularly significant, especially in areas where kangaroos are common. 
<h1>Natural Causes:</h1>
<h1>Starvation:</h1>
Kangaroos can die from starvation during droughts or when competition for resources increases, as seen in the 2017-2021 period when millions of kangaroos died. 
<h1>Disease:</h1>
Outbreaks of diseases, such as those associated with insects, can lead to blindness, arthritis, and death in kangaroos. 
<h1>Predation:</h1>
Kangaroos are vulnerable to predators like dingos, especially older or sick individuals. 
<h1>Old Age:</h1>
While kangaroos can live for up to 18 years in the wild, they rarely reach that age due to the harsh conditions, according to BBC News. 
<h1>Human-Related Causes:</h1>
<h1>Vehicle Collisions:</h1>
Collisions with vehicles are a major cause of kangaroo mortality, particularly in areas with high traffic. 
<h1>Hunting:</h1>
Kangaroos are hunted for their meat and skin, and this is a significant factor in some areas. 
<h1>Environmental Changes:</h1>
Habitat loss and fragmentation due to human activities can also contribute to kangaroo deaths. 
<h1>Other Factors:</h1>
Kangaroo Deaths in Specific Regions:
For example, a recent ABC News reported that more than 80 kangaroos were found dead in two regional Victorian locations, some with gunshot wounds and others with traumatic injuries from being struck by vehicles. 
<h1>Rare Fatal Attacks:</h1>
While extremely rare, kangaroos can sometimes fatally attack humans, particularly if they feel cornered or are being kept as pets, according to a report in The New York Times.
