             <h1>ABOUT QUARTZ</h1>
Quartz is a hard, crystalline mineral composed of silicon dioxide (SiO2). It's the second most abundant mineral in Earth's continental crust, after feldspar. Quartz exists in various forms and colors, with many varieties used as gemstones. 
<h1>Here's a more detailed look:</h1>
<h1>Composition and Structure:</h1>
Quartz is made up of silicon and oxygen atoms arranged in a framework of SiO4 tetrahedra, where each oxygen atom is shared between two tetrahedra. </p>
This structure gives quartz a crystalline form and a chemical formula of SiO2, or silica. </p>
<h1>Varieties and Colors:</h1>
Pure quartz is colorless, but impurities can cause a wide range of colors, including white (milky quartz), purple (amethyst), yellow/orange (citrine), pink (rose quartz), and brown/black (smoky quartz). </p>
Examples of gemstone varieties include amethyst, citrine, rose quartz, and smoky quartz, and also include microcrystalline varieties like agate and jasper.</p> 
<h1>Properties:</h1>
Quartz has a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale, meaning it's harder than most common minerals and is resistant to abrasion. </p>
It exhibits piezoelectric properties, meaning it can generate an electric charge when subjected to mechanical stress, making it useful in electronic devices like clocks and watches. </p>
Quartz is also known for its ability to rotate the plane of polarized light, a property called optical activity. </p>
<h1>Uses:</h1>
<p>Quartz is a major component of beach sand and many types of rocks, including granite. </p>
<p>It's used in the production of glass, ceramics, and abrasives.</p> 
<p>In electronics, quartz crystals are used in oscillators for timekeeping and frequency control. </p>
<p>It's also used in optical devices due to its high transparency and ability to transmit ultraviolet light.</p>
<p>In the past, quartz was used for jewelry and hardstone carvings. </p>
<p>Quartz is also used in spiritual practices and for its purported healing properties. </p>
