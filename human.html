             <h1>ABOUT HUMAN</h1>
Human death, in essence, is the irreversible cessation of all biological functions necessary to maintain life. This includes the cessation of heart beat, breathing, and brain activity. While brain activity might linger for a few minutes, it doesn't equate to consciousness or awareness. Death is a natural part of life, and it can be caused by various factors, including age, disease, accidents, and trauma. 
<h1>Stages of Death:</h1>
<h1>Physiological Death:</h1>
This refers to the moment when vital organs, like the heart and lungs, stop functioning.
<h1>Social Death:</h1>
This describes the point when individuals begin to withdraw emotionally and physically from a person who is terminally ill.
<h1>Psychological Death:</h1>
This stage occurs when a person begins to accept the inevitability of death and may withdraw from social interaction. 
<h1>Post-Mortem Changes:</h1>
<h1>Algor Mortis:</h1>
 The body's temperature gradually decreases after death. 
<h1>Rigor Mortis:</h1>
 Muscles stiffen due to chemical changes, peaking around 7-12 hours after death, then relaxing again. 
<h1>Livor Mortis:</h1>
 Blood settles in the lowest part of the body, causing discoloration. 
<h1>Putrefaction:</h1> 
Decomposition of the body begins as bacteria multiply. 
<h1>Defining Death:</h1>
<h1>Whole-brain standard:</h1>
This definition considers death to be the irreversible cessation of all brain functions, including the brainstem. 
<h1>Cardiopulmonary standard:</h1>
This older definition focuses on the irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions. 
<h1>Causes of Death:</h1>
<h1>Natural Causes:</h1>
 These include age, disease, and genetic factors. 
<h1>Unnatural Causes:</h1>
 These include accidents, suicides, and homicides. 
<h1>Leading Causes of Death: </h1>
In low-income countries, malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS are major contributors, while heart disease, cancer, and preventable injuries are leading causes in the United States.
